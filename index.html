                <p class="par-1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honesty feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
                <p class="par-2">" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looming to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>

                <p class="par-1">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <p class="par-2">" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professsional who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about this program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, wwas outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!. "</p>
